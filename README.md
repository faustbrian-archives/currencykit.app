# CurrencyKit

This repository contains the source code of [CurrencyKit](https://currencykit.app/). It is a small [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) application that indexes historical foreign exchange rates published by the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html). It exposes a simple REST API to access the data and perform exchanges between the available currencies.
